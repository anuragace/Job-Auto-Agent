job_description = """
We are seeking a talented and driven AI Engineer to join our cross-functional AI innovation team within a leading pharmaceutical organization. You will work on designing, developing, and deploying GenAI-driven solutions, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and scalable ML-powered applications across cloud-native environments to support drug development, regulatory, manufacturing, and commercial operations. The ideal candidate combines a strong academic foundation in machine learning with hands-on experience building real-world AI systems and full-stack applications that comply with the high standards of a regulated industry.

Essential Functions

Design and implement GenAI applications including LLM-integrated tools, RAG systems, and intelligent chatbots tailored for pharmaceutical functions such as R& D knowledge mining, regulatory intelligence, and medical information services.
Build and optimize data ingestion, transformation, and semantic search pipelines using domain-specific embedding models (e.g., BioBERT, Ada-002).
Develop and containerize AI services using FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes, deployed on AWS or GCP, ensuring adherence to data privacy and compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, GxP).
Collaborate with product, data, and platform engineering teams to integrate AI features into validated systems supporting clinical, quality, and manufacturing workflows.
Contribute to end-to-end MLOps: model experimentation, deployment pipelines, audit readiness, monitoring, and performance tuning.
Engineer full-stack applications (React + REST/GraphQL backends) with role-based access controls for internal and external scientific and business users.
Support internal research and POCs on advanced topics like LLM reasoning, adverse event detection, pharmacovigilance, and digital biomarker analysis.
